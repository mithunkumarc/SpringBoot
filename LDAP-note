Lightweight Directory Access protocol is an application protocol used for querying and modification purposes. 
Some examples of LDAP are Microsoftâ€™s active directory, OPEN LDAP.
We use LDAP as a source to store employee information in an organization.

Use case:

You're developing an in-house application for your company and the app might need employee details such as name, 
employee ID, position etc.. for various reasons. 
There would be constant querying (READ) operation to LDAP to retrieve the information.

You might ask why Database can't be used. It highly depends on the use case. 
If there's more READ operation and you need to store information such as roles, permissions of the user, 
LDAP store it in the tree structure. 
If frequent updates and inserts are essential, then choose database over LDAP as it's the ideal way.

LDAP is predominantly used application protocol for authentication purposes.

Therefore, use LDAP if there are frequent reads and choose database if there are frequent updates and inserts happening 
in the application.
