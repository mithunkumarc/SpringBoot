No more IT issues – the daily tasks, responsibilities, and stress of trying to manage a data center is

Increased security – Most businesses enhance their security by transitioning to the cloud, 
                      simply because good providers have infrastructure experts and security professionals on their team.

Improved teamwork – the ability to use collaboration tools makes it far easier for employees 
                    to work together as a team to increase productivity.

Agility – When we consider the laws of supply and demand, having a physical solution can be limiting.
          However, the cloud allows you to adapt quickly to changing user demand.

Disaster Ready – If some disaster happens at your physical location, you could lose all your data. 
                  While backing up your data is a wise decision, 
                   the cloud simplifies the backup process and makes it way easier to implement.
